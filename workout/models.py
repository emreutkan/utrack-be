        Based on sports science research: recovery is non-linear, exercise-specific, and multi-system.
        
        Fatigue Score Formula:
        - Base: 1.0 per set
        - RIR Multiplier: 0 RIR = 1.5x, 1-2 RIR = 1.0x, 3-4 RIR = 0.7x, 5+ RIR = 0.4x

        - Rest Time: <60s = +0.2x (metabolic stress), >3min = +0.1x (CNS fatigue)
        
        Recovery Hours Formula (Exercise-Specific):
        - Small muscles (biceps, calves): 36h base (faster protein synthesis)
        - Large muscles (quads, back, chest): 48h base (more structural damage)
        - Medium muscles (shoulders): 42h base
        - Volume scalar: If fatigue_score < 6.0, scale base hours proportionally (min 0.5x)
          This accounts for micro-dosing volume (e.g., 2 sets should not require full 36h base)
        - Fatigue multiplier: High fatigue (>20) = 1.5x, Moderate (>12) = 1.3x, Low (>6) = 1.1x
        - Volume penalty: >8 sets = +12h, >15 sets = +24h
        - Metabolic fatigue: Short rest on compound = +6h
        - Novelty penalty: Exercise not done in 4+ weeks = +12h (unaccustomed exercise causes more damage)
        - Eccentric emphasis: If eccentric_time is set = +8h (extends structural repair phase, more micro-tears)
        
        Recovery follows J-curve (non-linear):

        - 24-48h: Protein synthesis peak (accelerated recovery, 30-70%)
